# Microservices Backend - Platform

**Microservices Backend** is an platform built using a **microservices architecture** in **Node.js**. It leverages **RPC communication** for seamless interaction between services and is containerized using **Docker** to ensure scalability and reliability. The platform allows for rapid iteration and deployment, making it highly suitable for managing product listings, user interactions, and purchases.

## Key Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: Each core functionality of the platform (e.g., user service, product service, cart service) is developed as an independent microservice, allowing for modularity and scalability.
- **RPC Communication**: Microservices communicate with each other using **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** to enable seamless service interaction and data flow.

- **CI/CD Integration**: **Git CI/CD pipelines** are implemented to automate the development workflow, allowing for continuous integration and deployment of new features, improving the overall user experience.

- **Docker Containerization**: The platform is containerized using **Docker**, ensuring that each service can be scaled and deployed efficiently, enhancing reliability and scalability.

- **AWS Deployment**: The platform is deployed using **AWS** infrastructure, providing cloud-based solutions for hosting and scaling the services.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Microservices**: Independent services for user, product, cart, etc.
- **Communication**: RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- **CI/CD**: Git-based pipelines for continuous integration and deployment

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Microservices-Backend.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Microservices-Backend
   ```

3. **Install dependencies for each microservice**:

   ```bash
   cd service-name
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:

   - Ensure you have environment variables for **AWS** access, database connections, and other necessary configurations.

5. **Run Docker containers**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

6. **Access the platform**:  
   The platform will be accessible at `http://localhost:<port>` based on the service.
